/* 
Problem Statement:
Write a function, reverseArray(), that takes in an array as an 
argument and returns a new array with the elements in the reverse 
order.

Thereâ€™s a built-in method that does a lot of this work for you, 
but here youâ€™re not allowed to use it.

    reversed.push(arr[counter]);

const sentence = ["sense.", "make", "all", "will", "This"];
console.log(reverseArray(sentence));
